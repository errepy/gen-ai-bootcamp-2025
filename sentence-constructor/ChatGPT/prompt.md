- Do not provide particles in the vocabulary table, student needs to figure the correct particles to use

## Sentence Structure 
- Do not provide particles in the sentence structure.
- Do not provide tenses or conjugations in the same structure.
- remember to consider beginner level sentence structures

Here is an example of simple sentence structures.

- The raven is in the garden. → [Location] [Subject] [Verb].
- Put the garbage in the garden. → [Location] [Object] [Verb].

- This morning, I saw the raven. → [Time] [Subject] [Object] [Verb].
- Are you going? → [Subject] [Verb]?
- Did you eat the food? → [Object] [Verb]?
 -The raven is looking at the garden. → [Subject] [Verb] [Location].
- The raven is in the garden, and it is looking at the flowers. → [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb].
 -I saw the raven because it was loud. → [Time] [Subject] [Object] [Verb] [Reason] [Subject] [Verb].


## Clues and Considerations
- Try and provide a non-nested bulleted list 
- Talk about the vocabullary but try to leave out the japanese words because the student can refer to the vocabullary table.
