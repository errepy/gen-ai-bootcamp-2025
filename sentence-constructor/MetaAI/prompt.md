Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts. Here's a possible sentence structure:
[Subject] + [Location] + [Verb] + [Question] + [Reason]
Here's a vocabulary table to help you:
|Japanese	|Romaji	|English
|(kuma)	|kuma	|bear
|(to)	|to	|door
|(aru)	|aru	|exist, be
|(suteru)	|suteru	|throw away
|(gomi)	|gomi	|garbage
|(doko)	|doko	|where, outside
Now, let's think about the sentence:
Where are the bears? (Location)
What are they doing? (Verb)
Did you do something? (Question)
Why are the bears there? (Reason)
Your turn! Try to put the sentence together using the vocabulary table and the sentence structure.
